# SPEC-001 — Task Detailing for Junior Engineers

Provide clear, step-by-step task write-ups so junior contributors and Codex agents can execute reliably.

## Required Sections for Each Task Detail
1. **Summary** – concise description of the goal.
2. **Steps** – ordered list of actionable implementation tasks.
3. **Acceptance Criteria** – measurable checks verifying completion.
4. **Repositories Impacted** – list all repos requiring updates.
5. **Links** – reference specs, PRs, commits, or other resources.

## Writing Guidelines
- Keep instructions specific and testable.
- Reference code locations or files by path when possible.
- Highlight environment variables, configuration, and security requirements.
- Include manual validation steps for QA sign-off.
