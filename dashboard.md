## How to Use This Dashboard

1. Start here daily - review ready and in-progress tasks, then coordinate assignments.
2. Update after each change - when a task status shifts, update both the board and this dashboard summary.
3. Link supporting detail - for deeper context, follow the detail page links under each task row.

Keep the dashboard concise so it reflects the single source of truth without replacing the boards themselves.
