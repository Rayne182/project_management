# FND-011 â€” Postman Collection and Smoke Tests

## Summary
Create and automate a Postman collection that exercises key API endpoints to provide fast feedback on environment health.

## Steps
1. Build a Postman collection covering authentication, portfolio, transaction, notification, and health endpoints.
2. Parameterize variables for environments and credentials so the collection can run locally and in CI.
3. Author smoke test scripts to assert critical responses, status codes, and payload shapes.
4. Integrate the collection with CI tooling (e.g., Newman) for automated smoke runs.
5. Document how to execute the collection manually for troubleshooting.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A committed Postman collection exists with environment variables checked in or documented.
- Automated smoke runs pass against local and CI environments.
- Failing requests provide actionable assertions rather than silent errors.

## Repositories Impacted
