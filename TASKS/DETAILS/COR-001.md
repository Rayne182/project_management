# COR-001 â€” Implement Transaction Endpoints

## Summary
Build backend endpoints for deposits, withdrawals, transaction history, and webhook handling with full validation and idempotency safeguards.

## Steps
1. Design request and response DTOs for deposits, withdrawals, and transaction listings with necessary validation.
2. Implement command handlers that enforce idempotency keys and double-entry ledger posting.
3. Create webhook ingestion to reconcile external payment events with internal transaction status.
4. Add unit and integration tests covering happy paths, validation failures, and duplicate message handling.
5. Document API contracts and update OpenAPI/Swagger definitions accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Deposit and withdrawal endpoints enforce validation and persist double-entry ledger updates.
- Webhook events reconcile transaction status without duplicating ledger entries.
- API documentation and tests confirm idempotency and error handling behaviour.
