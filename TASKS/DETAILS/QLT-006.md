# QLT-006 â€” Accessibility Baseline

## Summary
Establish baseline accessibility compliance by improving semantics, touch targets, and contrast throughout key flows.

## Steps

2. Add semantic labels, accessibility roles, and dynamic type support as required.
3. Increase touch target sizes and spacing to meet platform guidelines.
4. Verify improvements with automated accessibility tooling and manual testing.
5. Document ongoing accessibility requirements for contributors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Core flows meet baseline accessibility checks for labels, contrast, and touch targets.
- Automated accessibility tooling passes without high severity issues.
- Documentation summarises current accessibility expectations and known follow-ups.
