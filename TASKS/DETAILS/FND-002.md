# FND-002 â€” Authentication Token Integration

## Summary
Add Axios request and response interceptors that attach the Firebase ID token to every outbound API call and automatically refresh it when required.

## Steps
1. Configure a shared Axios instance with request and response interceptors that run for all HTTP calls.
2. Inject the current Firebase access token into the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on every request.
3. Detect `401` responses, perform a single token refresh, and retry the failed request before surfacing an error.
4. Add exponential backoff and guardrails to prevent infinite retry loops or duplicate refresh requests.
5. Write unit coverage around the interceptor behaviour for success, refresh, and terminal failure scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Every request to the API includes a valid `Authorization` header populated from Firebase auth.
- Expired tokens are refreshed transparently with no more than one retry per request.
- Errors after refresh attempts are surfaced with actionable logging for debugging.
