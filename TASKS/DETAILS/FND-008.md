# FND-008 â€” Seed Development Data

## Summary
Seed the development database with questionnaires, demo portfolios, risk profiles, and sample transactions so developers can work against realistic data.

## Steps
1. Design seed scripts or EF Core data seeding to create demo users, portfolio accounts, and representative transactions.
2. Include questionnaires and risk profile data required for onboarding and recommendation flows.
3. Ensure seed logic is idempotent by upserting records instead of duplicating them.
4. Provide commands or tooling for developers to apply the seeds after running migrations.
5. Document the seeded accounts and credentials for quick reference.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Fresh development environments contain demo data without manual SQL scripts.
- Rerunning the seeding process does not create duplicate records.
- Developers can log in and exercise core scenarios with the seeded accounts.

## Repositories Impacted
