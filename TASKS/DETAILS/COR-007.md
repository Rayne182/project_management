# COR-007 â€” Portfolio Overview Real Data

## Summary
Wire the portfolio overview dashboard to live allocation and performance endpoints so users see real account data instead of mocks.

## Steps
1. Expose backend endpoints that provide allocation, performance, and key KPI metrics.
2. Update the mobile dashboard to request and display live data, replacing all placeholder content.
3. Handle loading, empty, and error states gracefully with informative messaging.
4. Validate that figures and charts match backend calculations and seeded data.
5. Add unit or snapshot tests to guard rendering and data transformations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dashboard tiles display live portfolio allocation and performance metrics with no hard-coded placeholders.
- Data remains consistent with backend calculations and seeded baseline values.
- Loading and error states provide clear guidance without degrading the user experience.
