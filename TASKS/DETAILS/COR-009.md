# COR-009 â€” Multi-Portfolio Support

## Summary
Enable users to manage multiple portfolios with appropriate access roles and CRUD operations across the stack.

## Steps
1. Extend backend models and endpoints to support multiple portfolios per user with role-based access (owner, editor, viewer).
2. Implement create, update, and delete operations with concurrency safeguards.
3. Update the mobile UI to list portfolios, allow switching context, and manage membership roles.
4. Ensure permissions restrict actions based on assigned roles.
5. Provide automated tests covering access control and portfolio lifecycle flows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can create, edit, and delete portfolios within allowed roles.
- Switching between portfolios updates dashboards, activity, and settings accordingly.
- Access control prevents users from performing actions beyond their role.
