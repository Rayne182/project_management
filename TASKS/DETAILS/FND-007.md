# FND-007 â€” Set Up Local Database and Migrations

## Summary
Provision the local SQL Server container, configure EF Core contexts, and create initial migrations so developers can build and update the schema reliably.

## Steps
1. Configure EF Core contexts for ledger, notification, and compliance domains with accurate entity mappings.
2. Create the initial migration set and ensure the migration history is committed.
3. Automate running `dotnet ef database update` against the local SQL Server container during setup.
4. Document steps for resetting the database and rerunning migrations for new developers.
5. Validate schema creation end-to-end within local development workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running migrations on a clean environment produces all required tables without manual intervention.
- Reapplying migrations remains idempotent and leaves the database in a consistent state.
- Documentation covers setup and troubleshooting for the local database container.
