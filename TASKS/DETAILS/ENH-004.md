# ENH-004 â€” Biometric and Dark Mode Support

## Summary
Enable biometric authentication and dark theme toggling to enhance security and user preference support.

## Steps
1. Integrate Expo Local Authentication or native modules to support biometric unlock on supported devices.
2. Implement a persistent theme toggle that switches between light and dark modes.
3. Ensure theming extends across core screens, respecting accessibility contrast guidelines.
4. Provide fallbacks when biometrics are unavailable or fail validation.
5. Add tests and documentation covering biometric setup and theming behaviour.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can opt into biometric authentication and successfully unlock the app.
- Theme selections persist across sessions and apply consistently.
- Dark mode meets accessibility contrast requirements.
