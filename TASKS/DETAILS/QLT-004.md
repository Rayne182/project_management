# QLT-004 â€” CI/CD Pipeline

## Summary
Create GitHub Actions pipelines that lint, test, build, and produce artifacts for both the mobile and backend projects.

## Steps
1. Define workflow jobs for linting, unit tests, integration tests, and builds across repositories.
2. Configure environment setup steps, including dependencies, secrets, and database migrations for integration tests.
3. Publish build artifacts or test reports for downstream consumption.
4. Require pipeline success for pull request merges.
5. Document the pipeline structure and how to troubleshoot failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- GitHub Actions workflows execute linting, testing, and build stages for both repositories.
- EF Core migrations run as part of integration tests with clean setup/teardown.
- Pull requests cannot merge without passing the pipeline.

## Repositories Impacted
