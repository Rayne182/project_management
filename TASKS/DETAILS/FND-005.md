# FND-005 â€” Implement Error Boundary

## Summary
Introduce a global error boundary component that captures runtime exceptions, provides a user-friendly fallback, and reports issues to the error tracking service.

## Steps
1. Build a reusable error boundary component with `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError` logic.
2. Render a branded fallback UI that allows the user to retry or return home when a crash occurs.
3. Log captured errors to the chosen telemetry provider with sufficient context for debugging.
4. Wrap the root navigation or app container with the new error boundary.
5. Add tests verifying that the boundary catches errors and renders the fallback UI as expected.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Runtime errors no longer display the default red screen in production builds.
- Captured errors are forwarded to the configured telemetry destination.
- Users can recover by retrying or navigating away without forcing an app restart.
