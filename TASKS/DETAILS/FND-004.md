# FND-004 â€” Remove Hard-Coded User Data

## Summary
Replace static user identifiers and mock datasets across the app so views consume context-driven values and live API responses.

## Steps
1. Audit the mobile codebase for hard-coded user IDs, mock arrays, and placeholder data sources.
2. Replace those references with values supplied by the authentication context and remote API calls.
3. Add skeleton loaders or fallback UI while data requests resolve to avoid blank screens.
4. Remove unused mock utilities and ensure tests cover the new dynamic behaviour.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No hard-coded user IDs or mock datasets remain in production code.
- Screens render using live context or API data with graceful loading states.
- Linting and tests confirm no references to the old mock utilities persist.

## Repositories Impacted
