# FND-009 â€” Local API Connectivity

## Summary
Ensure the mobile application can reliably communicate with the local API using the appropriate host configuration for simulators and devices.

## Steps
1. Detect the running platform (simulator, emulator, physical device) and determine the correct base URL (`localhost`, `10.0.2.2`, etc.).
2. Update environment configuration so the Axios client resolves the correct host automatically.
3. Verify connectivity to the API `health` and core endpoints from iOS and Android development targets.
4. Document troubleshooting tips for common local networking issues and port forwarding.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The mobile app can reach local API endpoints from both iOS and Android development environments.
- Switching between simulator and device updates the host without code changes.
- Connectivity validation steps are documented for developers setting up their environments.
