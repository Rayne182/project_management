# COR-005 â€” Settings and Preferences

## Summary
Complete the account settings and preferences screens so users can review and update their profile, consents, and notification preferences.

## Steps
1. Design or refine settings UI for account info, preferences, and consent toggles.
2. Integrate GET and PUT endpoints to load and persist account data.
3. Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback if the API call fails.
4. Capture consent timestamps and audit requirements where necessary.
5. Add automated tests for core preference changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can view and edit profile details and preferences successfully.
- Consent changes are timestamped and persisted to the backend.
- Optimistic updates show immediate feedback and recover gracefully from errors.
