# FND-010 â€” Align DTOs with Database Schema

## Summary
Review TypeScript interfaces and backend DTOs to ensure they remain in sync with the database schema and provide strict typing guarantees.

## Steps
1. Inventory the backend DTOs and SQL schema for key domains (auth, portfolios, transactions).
2. Update TypeScript interfaces and models in the mobile app to match backend field names and data types.
3. Enforce strict typing by enabling appropriate compiler checks or lint rules where necessary.
4. Coordinate updates between backend DTOs and EF entities to eliminate mismatches.
5. Add tests or build-time validation to catch future schema drift.

## Acceptance Criteria
- TypeScript and backend DTO definitions match field-for-field with the database schema.
- Type checking passes with no implicit `any` or structural mismatches.
- Data exchanged between app and API serializes and deserializes without runtime shape issues.
