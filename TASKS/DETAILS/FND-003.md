# FND-003 â€” Authentication Context Provider

## Summary
Create a React context provider that exposes authentication state, user profile data, and helper methods so the mobile app can coordinate sign-in, sign-out, and token refresh flows.

## Steps
1. Implement an `AuthProvider` that reads persisted credentials, manages Firebase tokens, and exposes context values and actions.
2. Persist the refresh token securely (e.g., SecureStore) and ensure it is rehydrated when the app boots.
3. Load the authenticated user profile on start-up and refresh it when credentials change.
4. Provide hooks or context consumers for screens to access `user`, `signIn`, `signOut`, and `refresh` helpers.
5. Gate protected routes or navigation stacks behind the auth context so unauthenticated users cannot access secured screens.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Authenticated state persists across app restarts and tokens refresh without manual input.
- Protected screens remain inaccessible when a user is signed out or tokens expire.
- Signing out clears sensitive data and returns the app to the authentication flow.
