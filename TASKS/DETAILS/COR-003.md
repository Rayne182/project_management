# COR-003 â€” Activity Screen

## Summary
Create a transaction activity screen that lists historical activity with filters, pagination, and pull-to-refresh support.

## Steps
1. Design the activity screen layout with sections for filters, list content, and empty states.
2. Implement paginated data fetching using the chosen state management or query library.
3. Add filter controls (date range, type, status) and wire them to the data source.
4. Provide pull-to-refresh behaviour and loading indicators for additional pages.
5. Ensure accessibility and performance best practices for long lists.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can scroll through paginated transaction history without noticeable performance issues.
- Filters adjust the dataset immediately and empty states are informative.
- Pull-to-refresh reloads the latest transactions successfully.
