# COR-006 â€” State Management and Caching

## Summary
Introduce a state management and caching strategy to reduce redundant API calls and enable offline reads for cached data.

## Steps
1. Select or confirm a query/state management library (e.g., React Query, SWR) suitable for the Expo app.
2. Define cache keys for user profile, "me" endpoints, transactions, and other frequently accessed data.
3. Implement caching policies including stale times, background refresh, and invalidation triggers.
4. Provide offline or fallback reads from cache when the network is unavailable.
5. Update documentation and tests to reflect the new data fetching patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Frequently accessed endpoints use shared cached queries instead of bespoke fetch logic.
- Cached data persists long enough to reduce redundant calls while staying fresh.
- Offline reads return the most recent cached data with clear offline indicators.
