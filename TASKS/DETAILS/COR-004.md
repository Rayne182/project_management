# COR-004 â€” Notifications System

## Summary
Implement backend notification storage and delivery plus a mobile notification feed that surfaces unread updates to users.

## Steps
1. Create backend models, endpoints, and persistence for storing notifications and marking them as read.
2. Stub the email sender or push integration to support future delivery channels.
3. Build a mobile notification list with badges, read/unread states, and navigation to relevant content.
4. Add mutation flows to mark notifications as read and sync state across sessions.
5. Cover key flows with integration tests and UX validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Backend endpoints allow listing, marking as read, and creating notifications.
- Mobile clients display badges for unread notifications and show a detailed feed.
- Read status persists across sessions and updates in real time after user interaction.
