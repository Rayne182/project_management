# LCH-003 â€” Observability and Alerts

## Summary
Set up production-grade observability including metrics dashboards, uptime checks, and alerting workflows.

## Steps
1. Define key metrics and dashboards for application health, performance, and business KPIs.
2. Configure uptime and synthetic monitoring for public endpoints.
3. Implement alerting rules that notify the appropriate channels on threshold breaches.
4. Propagate correlation IDs through logs and traces for end-to-end visibility.
5. Document operational runbooks for responding to alerts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dashboards provide real-time visibility into application and business metrics.
- Alerts fire during simulated outages and reach the intended recipients.
- Runbooks outline standard procedures for triaging and resolving incidents.
