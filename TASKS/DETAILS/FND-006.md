# FND-006 â€” Enforce Authorization and Token Validation

## Summary
Enable authorization enforcement across the API by validating Firebase JWTs, tightening development CORS settings, and ensuring user context is available in logs.

## Steps
1. Turn on `[Authorize]` attributes or global filters for controllers that require authenticated access.
2. Validate incoming Firebase JWTs, including signature, issuer, audience, and expiration checks.
3. Configure CORS to restrict allowed origins for development and ensure headers support credentialed requests.
4. Populate structured logs with authenticated user context for traceability.
5. Add integration tests covering authorized, unauthorized, and forbidden access paths.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unauthenticated requests are rejected with appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Valid tokens allow access and user identity is visible in API logs.
- Development CORS rules prevent unintended origins while still enabling the mobile app and tooling.
