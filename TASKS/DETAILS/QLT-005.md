# QLT-005 â€” Performance Optimisation

## Summary
Optimise list rendering, charts, and media handling to deliver smooth experiences on mid-range Android devices.

## Steps
1. Profile list and chart components to identify rendering bottlenecks or unnecessary re-renders.
2. Apply memoization, virtualization, or batching strategies as needed.
3. Optimise image loading and caching policies.
4. Measure performance improvements using React Native performance tools or profiling.
5. Document best practices adopted for future contributors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Core lists and charts scroll smoothly on target Android devices.
- Performance metrics show measurable improvements versus the baseline.
- Guidelines for maintaining performance regressions are documented.

## Repositories Impacted
