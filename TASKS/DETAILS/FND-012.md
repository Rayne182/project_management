# FND-012 â€” Development Logging and Telemetry

## Summary
Add structured logging and telemetry that developers can enable in development builds without exposing sensitive data.

## Steps
1. Select or confirm the logging and telemetry tooling for both mobile and API layers.
2. Add structured request logging with correlation IDs and error reporting hooks guarded by environment flags.
3. Ensure logs redact or omit sensitive data to maintain privacy compliance.
4. Provide developer documentation for enabling, disabling, and reviewing telemetry output locally.
5. Add automated checks or linting to prevent accidental logging of secrets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Developers can toggle verbose logging and telemetry in development builds without code changes.
- Errors and key events produce structured logs that aid debugging while protecting PII.
- Documentation covers how to capture and share logs when triaging issues.
