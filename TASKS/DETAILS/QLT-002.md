# QLT-002 â€” Unit and Integration Tests

## Summary
Increase automated test coverage across mobile and backend services to reach the 70% target on critical paths.

## Steps
1. Identify critical flows lacking coverage on both the mobile app (Jest) and backend (xUnit/integration).
2. Write unit tests for core business logic, reducers, and utilities.
3. Add integration tests that exercise API endpoints, database interactions, and authentication.
4. Configure coverage thresholds in CI and fail builds that do not meet the target.
5. Document how to run the test suites locally and interpret coverage reports.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Combined automated tests cover at least 70% of critical path code.
- CI enforces coverage thresholds for both mobile and backend projects.
- Developers have clear guidance for running and extending the test suites.
