# COR-008 â€” Risk Assessment Integration

## Summary
Connect the mobile risk questionnaire flow to backend scoring services so results persist and influence portfolio recommendations.

## Steps
1. Integrate the questionnaire UI with backend endpoints for fetching questions and submitting answers.
2. Capture and store the resulting risk score in backend services.
3. Update mobile state to consume the saved risk score and adjust recommendations or messaging.
4. Handle resubmission and updates for users who retake the questionnaire.
5. Add tests validating scoring calculations and UI state transitions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can complete the questionnaire and receive a persisted risk score.
- Subsequent recommendations reference the stored risk profile accurately.
- Repeating the questionnaire updates the stored score and downstream views appropriately.
