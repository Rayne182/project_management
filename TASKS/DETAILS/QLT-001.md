# QLT-001 â€” Enable TypeScript Strict Mode

## Summary
Enable TypeScript strict mode and remediate typing issues to improve compile-time safety across the mobile application.

## Steps
1. Turn on TypeScript strict flags (e.g., `strict`, `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`) in the configuration.
2. Address resulting type errors throughout the codebase, introducing appropriate interfaces and guards.
3. Update linting or build scripts to enforce the stricter configuration in CI.
4. Add documentation for new typing patterns or utilities created during the migration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The project builds successfully with strict mode enabled.
- No remaining implicit `any` or unsafe null handling warnings exist.
- CI runs TypeScript checks with the new configuration and blocks regressions.

## Repositories Impacted
- finomi-app-ts
- project_management
