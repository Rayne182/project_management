# QLT-003 â€” Detox E2E Happy Path

## Summary
Automate the core happy path journeys (login, deposit, activity review) using Detox end-to-end tests.

## Steps
1. Configure Detox for the Expo application, including build scripts and device configuration.
2. Write end-to-end tests covering authentication, deposit flow, and viewing activity history.
3. Ensure tests handle asynchronous waits reliably to avoid flakiness.
4. Integrate Detox runs into CI with appropriate device/simulator setup.
5. Document local setup instructions for developers to reproduce failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Detox tests execute successfully locally and in CI.
- The happy path journeys run consistently without flakiness across supported platforms.
- Documentation enables developers to run and debug Detox locally.
