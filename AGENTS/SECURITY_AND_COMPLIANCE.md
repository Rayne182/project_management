# Security and Compliance Guidelines

- Align backend authentication with POPIA and FSCA requirements.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit; enforce HTTPS across environments.
- Maintain audit trails for authentication events and data mutations.
- Follow least-privilege access controls for infrastructure and CI/CD secrets.
- Record compliance checks and remediation in `REPORTS/SECURITY_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md`.
