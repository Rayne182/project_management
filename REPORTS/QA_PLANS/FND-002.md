Status: not-tested
Comments:

Pre‑requisites
- Valid Firebase setup in app; API reachable from device

Steps
1) Sign up or log in; open an authenticated screen.
2) Verify in server logs the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
3) Force token expiry (wait or revoke) and repeat a request.
4) Confirm single refresh + retry occurs.

Expected
- All requests include Authorization; transparent refresh with at most one retry; actionable errors on failure.
