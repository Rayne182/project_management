Links
- Task Detail: ../../TASKS/DETAILS/COR-006.md
- FE Doc: ../../../finomi-app-ts/docs/state-caching.md

Status: not-tested
Comments:

Steps
1) Open Fund Performance → observe first load (API call).
2) Navigate away/back within 60s → faster (cache hit), no API call.
3) After 60s → expect fresh call.

Expected
- Lightweight GET cache works as documented.
